## Security Design

### Constant-Time Operations

The constant-time layer (`ct::` namespace) provides:

- `ct::field_mul`, `ct::field_inv` -- timing-safe field arithmetic
- `ct::scalar_mul` -- timing-safe scalar multiplication
- `ct::point_add_complete`, `ct::point_dbl` -- complete addition formulas

The CT layer uses no secret-dependent branches or memory access patterns. It carries a ~5-7x performance penalty relative to the optimized (variable-time) path.

**Important**: The default (non-CT) operations prioritize performance and are NOT constant-time. Use the `ct::` variants when processing secret keys or nonces.

### ECDSA & Schnorr

- ECDSA: Deterministic nonces via RFC 6979 (no random nonce generation needed)
- Schnorr: BIP-340 compliant with tagged hashing
- Both signature schemes include validation of inputs (point-on-curve, scalar range checks)

### Memory Handling

- No dynamic allocation in hot paths
- **Library-side secret erasure**: `ct::schnorr_sign` and `ct::ecdsa_sign` automatically erase all intermediate nonces, scalar buffers, hash intermediates, and serialized key material via `secure_erase` (volatile function-pointer trick + `explicit_bzero` on glibc/BSD, `std::atomic_signal_fence` compiler barrier). The compiler cannot elide this erasure.
- `value_barrier` applied to CT mask derivations to prevent compiler speculation
- Fixed-size POD types used throughout (no hidden copies)
- Callers should still erase their own copies of private keys after use

## Fuzz Testing

libFuzzer harnesses cover the core arithmetic layers:

| Target | File | Operations |
|--------|------|------------|
| Field  | `cpu/fuzz/fuzz_field.cpp` | add/sub round-trip, mul identity, square, inverse |
| Scalar | `cpu/fuzz/fuzz_scalar.cpp` | add/sub, mul identity, distributive law |
| Point  | `cpu/fuzz/fuzz_point.cpp` | on-curve check, negate, compress round-trip, dbl vs add |

```bash
# Example: run field fuzzer
clang++ -fsanitize=fuzzer,address -O2 -std=c++20 \
  -I cpu/include cpu/fuzz/fuzz_field.cpp cpu/src/field.cpp cpu/src/field_asm.cpp \
  -o fuzz_field
./fuzz_field -max_len=64 -runs=10000000
```

## Scope

UltrafastSecp256k1 provides:

- Finite field arithmetic (𝔽ₚ for secp256k1 prime)
- Scalar arithmetic (mod n, curve order)
- Elliptic curve point operations (add, double, scalar multiply, multi-scalar)
- Batch inverse (Montgomery trick)
- ECDSA signatures (RFC 6979)
- Schnorr signatures (BIP-340)
- MuSig2 / FROST / Adaptor Signatures / Pedersen Commitments
- Taproot (BIP-341/342)
- HD key derivation (BIP-32/44)
- 27-coin address generation dispatch
- SHA-256 / tagged hashing
- GPU-accelerated batch operations (CUDA, ROCm, OpenCL, Metal)
- Constant-time layer (`ct::` namespace)

**Out of scope**: Key storage, wallet software, network protocols, consensus rules, and application-layer cryptographic protocols. Security responsibility for higher-level integrations remains with the integrating application.

## API Stability

The public API is **not yet stable**. Breaking changes may occur in any minor release before v4.0.

Layers marked "Stable" in the Production Readiness table above have mature interfaces that are unlikely to change, but no formal compatibility guarantee exists until v4.0.

For detailed stability classifications, see:
- [docs/adoption/API_STABILITY.md](docs/adoption/API_STABILITY.md) -- Tiered header classification (Stable / Provisional / Experimental / Internal)
- [docs/ABI_VERSIONING.md](docs/ABI_VERSIONING.md) -- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH + ABI version
- [docs/DEPRECATION_POLICY.md](docs/DEPRECATION_POLICY.md) -- 2 minor release deprecation cycle
- [docs/LTS_POLICY.md](docs/LTS_POLICY.md) -- 12-month LTS, SemVer 2.0.0

### Severity Guidelines

| CVSS | Example |
|------|---------|

For detailed eligibility criteria, scope, and reward guidelines, see
[docs/BUG_BOUNTY.md](docs/BUG_BOUNTY.md).

Summary of scope:
- **In scope**: Field/scalar/point arithmetic, ECDSA/Schnorr/MuSig2/FROST correctness, constant-time violations, memory safety, GPU kernel correctness
