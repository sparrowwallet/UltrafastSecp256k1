## 📜 Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributors **MUST** sign off their commits to certify they have the legal right to submit the contribution under the project's license. This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

By adding a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages, you certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by you, and you have the right to submit it under the MIT license; or
2. The contribution is based on previous work that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open-source license; or
3. The contribution was provided to you by someone who certified (1) or (2), and you have not modified it.

### How to Sign Off

Add `-s` (or `--signoff`) to your `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add new feature"
```

This appends a line like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

All commits in a pull request **must** include this sign-off line. Commits without it will not be accepted.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow
- Maintain professional communication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build g++-13 clang-tidy

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S cmake ninja gcc clang

# macOS
brew install cmake ninja llvm
```

### Development Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrec/UltrafastSecp256k1.git
cd UltrafastSecp256k1
cmake -S . -B build-dev -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DSECP256K1_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-dev -j
```

## 🔄 Development Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
4. **Push** to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. **Open** a Pull Request

### Strict Branch Governance (Mandatory)

This repository follows a strict two-branch model.

1. `dev` is the only integration branch for active development.
2. `main` is release-only and must remain stable.
3. Direct feature work on `main` is not allowed.
4. Release flow is always: `dev` -> `main` -> full CI -> release tag.
5. If CI is red after merging `dev` into `main`, release is blocked until green.
6. Emergency hotfixes on `main` must be merged/cherry-picked back into `dev` immediately after the fix.

Operationally:

1. Work is done in short-lived branches from `dev` (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `perf/*`, `docs/*`).
2. Those branches merge into `dev` only after checks pass.
3. At release time, current `dev` state is merged into `main`.
4. Release artifacts are created only from `main` after CI passes.

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `perf/` - Performance improvements
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

## 📝 Coding Standards

> **Full reference:** [docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/shrec/UltrafastSecp256k1/blob/main/docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md)

The complete coding standards document covers naming, formatting, hot-path contracts, memory model, cryptographic correctness, GPU rules, and commit standards. Below is a summary.

### C++ Style

- **Standard**: C++20
- **Formatting**: ClangFormat (`.clang-format` provided)
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions: `snake_case`
  - Variables: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Member variables: `m_snake_case` or `snake_case_`

### Code Example

```cpp
namespace secp256k1::fast {

class FieldElement {
public:
    FieldElement() = default;
    
    static FieldElement from_hex(std::string_view hex);
    
    FieldElement operator+(const FieldElement& other) const;
    
private:
    std::array<uint64_t, 4> m_limbs{};
};

} // namespace secp256k1::fast
```

### Documentation

- Use Doxygen-style comments for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms
- Include performance characteristics where relevant

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Multiply two field elements modulo p
 * 
 * @param a First operand
 * @param b Second operand
 * @return Product a * b (mod p)
 * 
 * @note This operation is constant-time
 * @performance ~8ns on x86-64 with assembly, ~25ns portable
 */
FieldElement field_mul(const FieldElement& a, const FieldElement& b);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
ctest --test-dir build-dev --output-on-failure

# Specific test
./build-dev/cpu/tests/test_field

# With verbose output
ctest --test-dir build-dev -V
```

### Adding Tests

- Place tests in `cpu/tests/` or `cuda/tests/`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include performance regression tests

```cpp
TEST(FieldElement, MultiplicationIsCommutative) {
    auto a = FieldElement::from_hex("1234...");
    auto b = FieldElement::from_hex("5678...");
    
    EXPECT_EQ(a * b, b * a);
}
```

## 📤 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Build** successfully: `cmake --build build-dev`
2. **Pass all tests**: `ctest --test-dir build-dev`
3. **Format code**: `clang-format -i <files>`
